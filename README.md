- Establishment of global AI standards
  - If international AI governance is implemented
    - Then: Consistent ethical and safety guidelines
    - Else: Fragmented AI development landscape
- Safeguards against misuse
  - If robust international regulations are established
    - Then: Reduced risk of AI weaponization and malicious use
    - Else: Potential for AI arms race
      
## Else: Slower AI Progress
- Gradual integration of AI technologies
- Continued human dominance in creative and complex cognitive tasks
- Focused AI applications in specific domains
- Balanced approach to AI adoption and regulation

## Key Considerations
- The cost of intelligence is plummeting, but the value of human ingenuity in applying AI will skyrocket [Schelling AI, p.4]
- AI Atlantis: A digital realm with 100 billion AI agents and a billion robots, all as competent as university graduates [Schelling AI, p.1]
- The global generative AI market is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032 [Schelling AI, p.2]
- AI automation puts 300 million full-time jobs at risk, but also creates new AI-related roles [Schelling AI, p.4]
- The power to shape our AI-driven future is in our hands, requiring informed and proactive engagement [Schelling AI, p.11-12]- The potential for rogue AGI/ASI poses existential risks to humanity, necessitating robust alignment and control measures
- Adversarial use of AI technologies could lead to unprecedented cybersecurity threats, disinformation campaigns, and privacy invasions
- International cooperation and governance are crucial to mitigate risks and ensure responsible AI development
